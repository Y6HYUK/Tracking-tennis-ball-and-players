This project implements a **Tennis Ball and Player Tracking** system using **YOLOv8** for real-time object detection and tracking. The system is designed to:
- **Detect and track players (persons)** using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
- **Detect and track the tennis ball** using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.
- **Visualize detections** by drawing bounding boxes around players and the tennis ball in the video.
- **Save the annotated video** with tracking information for further analysis.
